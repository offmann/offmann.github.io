<h1>Thought Experiment:</h1>
<p>Imagine visually that the ideas that come to mind are represented in a 3D space where the ideas duplicate, fork, disappear, evolve while moving between people. In a sense, the space is a living mechanism where the main characters are the ideas not the people. Just like a person hosts a virus and transmits it, so he/she can do with an idea.</p>

<h2>Analogy:</h2>
<p>From a computer science perspective, the ideas are nodes in graph-oriented clusters that compete for resources (humans in this case) or work together with no conflict of interest.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<p>The idea of survival is one of the oldest ideas and with the most longevity and it's probably immortal (ironic ha!)</p>
<p>The 2 ideas: free markets and private ownership are "friends" because they both belong to the same tribe which is the abstract idea of capitalism.</p>
<p>The idea of "the earth is the center of the universe" for instance existed for a while and got extinct. Although you could argue that as silly as it sounds in our modern time, this idea is brought to life every time someone reads this poorly written lines.</p>

<h2>Bug or Feature:</h2>
<p>One could argue that ideas <strong>necessarily</strong> share similarities with other ideas. From an epistemology perspective for example, the ideas: rationalism and experimentalism are pure enemies. However, they undoubtedly agree on the importance of science and thus they both belong to the tribe of science.</p>

<h3>Open Questions:</h3>
<p>Which makes me think about this very idea discussed here, the meta-idea. I wonder what are the "physics" laws behind the meta-idea that make me write about it and how it's working so far.</p>
<p>If we can answer how do first principles work in this space of ideas, we can answer some good questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a good idea?</li>
<li>What makes a good idea?</li>
<li>Do bad ideas have rights to exist too?</li>
<li>Are we, human, required for the ideas to exist?</li>
</ul>

<p>To be continued...</p>
