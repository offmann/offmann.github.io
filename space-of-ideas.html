<h1> ideas are the masters  </h1>
<p>try to visualise the ideas that come to mind as entities that duplicate, fork, disappear, evolve while moving between people..</p>
<p>the main characters are the ideas not the people.</p>
<p>the idea emerges somehow (birth), gets in the head of someone (survival), tries to stay relevant (evolution)...  </p>
<p>from a computer science perspective, you can think of the ideas as nodes in graph-oriented clusters that compete for resources (humans in this case) and/or work together with no conflict of interest.</p>

<h4>examples:</h4>
<p>the idea of survival is one of the oldest ideas and with the most longevity and it's probably immortal (ironic ha!)</p>
<p>the 2 ideas: free markets and private ownership are "friends" because they both belong to the same tribe which is the abstract idea of capitalism.</p>
<p>the idea of "the earth is the center of the universe" for instance existed for a while and got extinct. Although you could argue that even when it's brought up in modern times either by belief (by flat earthers) or in history lessons or even here in this silly article, the idea of "flat earth" revives again.</p>
<p>the relationship between ideas as entities can be tricky. for example, from an epistemology perspective, the ideas: rationalism and experimentalism are pure enemies. however, they undoubtedly agree on the importance of science and thus they both belong to the "tribe" of science.</p>


<p>what about this very idea discussed here, the meta-idea. I wonder what are the laws of physics behind the meta-idea that make me write about it and how it's going so far.</p>
